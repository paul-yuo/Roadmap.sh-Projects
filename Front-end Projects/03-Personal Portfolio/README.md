# Personal Portfolio
This Project focuses on styling the HTML website, as the previous project continued to focus on CSS-responsive layout and applying design.
and enhance the overall design of this project.

The project includes: 
- A fully styled, responsive website with the same structure as the previous project.
- Consistent use of a chosen color scheme and typography.
- Proper use of CSS techniques like Flexbox, media queries, and the box model.
- A responsive navigation bar and well-styled contact form.
