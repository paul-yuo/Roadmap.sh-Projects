# Changelog Component
In this project, I built a simple component for a website that displays a changelog.  
A changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project or software.  
It is often used to keep users informed about the latest updates and improvements.

## Features
- Responsive layout using CSS `clamp()` for typography and media queries for smaller screens
- Theme switching (light and dark mode) using CSS variables
- JavaScript to toggle between light and dark themes
- Font Awesome icons for theme switcher (lightbulb and moon)
